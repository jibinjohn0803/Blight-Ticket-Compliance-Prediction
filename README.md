# Blight-Ticket-Compliance-Prediction
Here's my approach on blight ticket analysis and making prediction whether a ticket holder will be compliant or not in future. 

Considerations : 
1. Have defined my own definition for a ticket holder to be compliant which is:
        * The person pays fine within 6 months after judgement date
        * The person pays full amount for fine
        * The person pays fine prior to judgement (By own admission)
2. Filtered dataset for disposition cases which contained 'Responsible'


Found many conclusive results by finding trends/pattern in recent data
